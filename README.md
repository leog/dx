# DX - Enhancing logging developer experience
A lightweight tool to enhance your development workflow by processing command output with customizable transformations.

## Features

- **Custom static transformations**: Define string patterns in your command output and replace them with custom messages.

- **Custom dynamic transformations**: Supports function-based transformations

- **Easy Integration**: Works seamlessly with any command-line tool or script.

- **Developer-Friendly**: Improves readability and reduces noise in logs.

## Installation
To install DX globally, run:

```bash
pnpm install -g dx
```

Alternatively, you can install it locally in your project:

```bash
pnpm install --save-dev dx
```

## Usage

### 1. Create a Configuration File
  
Create a `dx.config.js` file in your project's root directory. This file defines the patterns and transformations for your command output.

Example:

```js
module.exports = {
  // Simple string replacement
  "Test match 1": "âœ… Test match 1 processed",
  
  // Function-based processing
  "Function match": (line) => `Processed: ${line}`,
};
```

### 2. Run Commands with DX

Use DX to run your commands and transform their output:

```bash
dx <your-command>
```

For example:

```bash
dx pnpm run dev
```

## Configuration Options

### String Matching

```js
module.exports = {
  "String contained in output line": "Replacement text for the entire line"
}
```

### Function Processing

```js
module.exports = {
  "String contained in output line": (line) => {
    // Custom processing logic
    return `Formatted: ${line}`;
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

- Missing configuration files

- Invalid configuration types

- Function processing errors

## Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
pnpm test
```
## Usage examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
dx echo "Testing DX tool"
